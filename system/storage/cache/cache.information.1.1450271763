Every product detail's page will show a value \r\nsimilar to &quot;Usually Ships in 2-3 days&quot;. It is also noted in the Shopping\r\n Cart, and informs you of how quickly an item will be ready to ship out.\r\n For example, some items will ship within 24 hours, others in a couple \r\ndays, while some may take as many as several weeks (especially custom \r\nproducts). The &quot;Availability&quot; value is an estimate. We do our best to \r\nship items out as quickly as possible, so we often get orders out more \r\nquickly than is noted by the &quot;Availability&quot; timeframe, but please do not\r\n count on that.&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The method of delivery - our Free shipping method is either FedEx \r\nGround (commercial addresses) or FedEx Home Delivery (residential \r\naddresses). FedEx Express Saver takes 3 business days; 2nd Day Air is \r\ntwo business days, and there are several options for Overnight delivery \r\nbased on the time of day to be delivered.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, please \r\nnote that delivery time is also based on &quot;business&quot; days. For example, \r\nif you place an order on Sunday, it's impossible for us to ship an item \r\nthe same day as all the shippers are closed.&lt;\/li&gt;&lt;\/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Shipping Offers&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Orders over $50 qualify for Free Shipping, which will be FedEx Ground\r\n or FedEx Home Delivery (5-7 days for cross-country delivery). Free \r\nshipping promotions are available on domestic shipments, within the \r\ncontinental United States, only.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating Cost&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;\/strong&gt; profit from shipping. Should you charge \r\nRush shipping, or if we're shipping your order internationally, your \r\nshipping cost will be exactly the same as we are charged by whichever \r\nshipping company is used to deliver your package. Shipping costs are \r\ncalculated on the website automatically during Checkout based on the \r\nweight of the items you are purchasing.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Shipping&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to make a purchase and have it shipped internationally,\r\n please send us an email at service [at ] wingtip [dot] com. Be sure to \r\ninclude a list of the products you'd like to purchase, your shipping \r\naddress, phone number, and the email address to which we should send a \r\nPaypal invoice (we currently only accept Paypal payments for orders \r\nshipped abroad). A member of our Customer Service team will contact you \r\nto make all the arrangements.
